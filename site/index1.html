            Deruny, or potato pancakes, are a perfect course for breakfast or dinner. They are usually freshly fried or
            baked. If you want to make a good batch of deruny, first off, you should make sure the potatoes are finely
            grated. Then, to diversify the flavor, add meat, slices of chopped onions, mushrooms, fresh herbs or a
            variety of spices. Alternatively, you could just keep it simple: potatoes and a pinch of salt.

            Ukrainian dishes often use a number of ingredients. Borscht is a direct proof of this. Initially, this dish was
            made of 30 ingredients but, of course, over time that number has decreased. However, the technique remains
            unchanged. Beef is placed in cold water to make a meat broth. Then the meat is taken out and other ingredients
            are added and cooked in a closed saucepan. Garlic fritters are given instead of bread and called pampushki by
            locals.

        <div class="content-block__header">Chicken Kiev</div>
        <div class="content-block__content">
            is the dish that has brought fame to Ukraine. The simple combination of fresh chicken filet with a piece of
            butter is considered to be quite exquisite all over the world. To ensure that butter does not flow during the
            frying, youâ€™ll need a lot of practice and true professionalism. Nowadays, chicken Kiev is served in fashionable
            restaurants across London and New York. It is always the first dish ordered by foodies visiting the Ukrainian
            capital.
